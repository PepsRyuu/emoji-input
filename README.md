# Emoji Input

An application that runs in the background, and when the hot key combination is used, opens up a dialog allowing you to type in an emoji from the list of available emojis.

Implemented using [Yue](https://github.com/yue/yue).

## Motivation

* The emoji options in Microsoft Teams are quite limited, and the ones that are there don't express what I want.
* While there's a native Windows 10 emoji input, it's limited to the font sizes that Teams provides which is tiny for emojis.
* This app bypasses the input size by entering the emoji as HTML, instead of text.
* You can customise the input dialog using HTML/CSS/JavaScript as it's separate from the .exe.
* Should also be possible to port this to Linux and Mac, but I'm not familiar with developing for them.

## How to use

**Keys:** `Windows` + `/`
